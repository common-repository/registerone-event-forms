== Description ==

RegisterONE is a unified, enterprise level event management platform.

This plugin allows event organizers & producers to build out and embed ticketing, registration, and floor mapping into your Wordpress site. Registrants can select booth locations, purchase assets, amenities and upgrades, upload documents and media files, provide e-signatures and pay for cart items. Create, deploy and manage multiple registration forms easily and efficiently from the RegisterONE platform with support for Stripe & Paypal payment gateways.

Advanced floor mapping gives you the ability to plot booths with different sizes and pricing. Advanced features include dynamic pricing and selectable areas by applicant type. You can also start the registration process with booth selection from your forward facing map.

To use, simply create and customize your forms from RegisterONE. Once completed, your form shortcodes can be found in the **Wordpress > Plugins > RegisterONE > Settings** screen ready to add to a page to generate your forms. Data is securely captured and stored in the cloud, allowing for easy administration of applicant details, media uploads, asset orders and purchases.

You need a <a href="https://www.registerone.com">RegisterONE.com</a> account to use this plugin.

== Features ==

**NEW with v3.7.0** - **Custom booth labels, borders and fill colors added**. Labels and numbers now display over each booth area with custom sizing. Borders can now be added to each area to define each area, with custom colors and width. Area fill colors can be customized based on area status (ie. Available, Reserved, Unavailable, etc). Mapping also supports booth grouping/restrictions by Applicant type (ie. Sponsors). This allows you to create one master form with one map that supports multiple applicant types with different booth areas restrictions. You can also setup dynamic pricing based on applicant type for maximum flexibility.

Use RegisterONE to plan, promote, market, deploy and repeat within one dynamic, integrated system. Solutions include event and marketing management, virtual digital profile builder, virtual digital marketing management, meetings and lead retrieval, ticketing app and asset tracking app for on-site management and e-commerce solutions.

Each solution is based on a series of modules which can be configured to your individual needs & event requirements. Use only what you need to maximize engagement and outreach. Services are fully GDPR and CCPA privacy policy compliant and uses global single sign-on (SSO) for access.
